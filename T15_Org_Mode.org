* *Introduction to Org-Mode*
** *Preparing emacs for Org-Mode*
+ cd to your new work directory
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd /vol_b/DB00xx/Database
    cp -vR /vol_b/zzStorage/T14_Advanced_Emacs .

+ Let's Open and close emacs, observe emacs startup behavior
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    emacs
    Quit emacs
  #+END_SRC
+ Copy the following file:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cp -v /vol_b/zzStorage/T15_Org_Mode/.emacs ~/
    emacs
  #+END_SRC
+ Compare what happened
+ Open the ~.emacs~ file you copied
  : emacs /vol_b/DB00xx/.emacs
+ Let's look at the code in this file
+ Save the file and Restart emacs
+ Go to your repo
+ Open "*README.org*" with emacs
  : emacs README.org
+ Add the following to the file:
  : #+TITLE: Digital Biology
  : #+AUTHOR: Your Name
  : #+EMAIL: Your Email

  : #+STARTUP: showall
+ Save the *README.org* file
+ Inside the *README.org*, add the following:

  * Welcome to Org mode

    Welcome, and thanks for trying out Org mode. Making outlines in
    Org is very simple. It is just text! Just start typing.
  * This is a headline, it starts with one or more stars
   A heading has one star, a sub-heading two, etc.
  * Working with lists
  ** Moving around in our outline
  ** Moving around headlines
  #+END_SRC
+ Save the file (*C-x C-s*). You will notice that the colors change,
  syntax highlighting is turned on, and Emacs understands you are
  working in Org mode
+ *Working with lists* Add the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  ** Lord of the Rings
     My favorite scenes are (in this order)
     1. The attack of the Rohirrim
     2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
        + this was already my favorite scene in the book
        + I really like Miranda Otto.
     3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
         - on DVD only
        He makes a really funny face when it happens.
     But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
     Important actors in this film are:
     - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
     - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
       him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
  #+END_SRC

 #+BEGIN_SRC
 You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and =verbatim=, and, if you must, +strike-through+
 #+END_SRC
+ Save the file
+ Make sure to commit all changes
