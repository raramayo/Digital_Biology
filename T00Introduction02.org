* *Introduction 102*
+ Why this course was created?
  + From Biology to Computers
    + Relaxed athmosphere
    + Teach them Unix
    + Teach them how to manipulate data
    + From manipulating data to analyzing data
    + Make them independent of the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
      | [[./00Data/T00/01.png]] |
    + The Evolution of Biology and Biological Data makes this essential
  + The problem with Bioinformaticists or Data Analysts
    + Few of them have a /true good/ Biological background
    + Most of them just might not be able to see subtle patterns and miss what is important
    + This last one is the main motivation of this class
  + Processing data is no different from doing wet-lab experiments
    + Good experimental design is essential
    + You need Controls (i.e., Positive Controls, Negative Controls)
    + You need to have meaningful Experimental Replicates
    + Avoid the: *Garbage In, Garbage Out*
  + This course has *no pre-requisites*
    + I will assume you know nothing and start at the beggining
    + I will show you the most efficient ways, I know, to do stuff
  + This is a *compact* class
    + You will be exposed to a lot of new knowledge
    + /Be patient with yourself/
    + /Drop anything else you are doing/
    + /Immerse yourself on the class material for these few coming days/
    + This is the only way to tryly benefit from this class
    + If you, /in addition to being here/ try to do something else, you will exhaust yourself and learn nothing
  + My expectations:
    + We have no exams
    + Lecture followed by a practical session
    + Before the following lecture, I recommend you watch the recording of the lecture (if any) and try to re-execute the steps on your own
    + Questions and problems should be discussed with your TA before the coming lecture 
    + Each one of you will be assigned a Git Repository that will be shared with me
    + You should update your Git Repo after each lecture
      + Deposit there whatever is related to the lecture
      + Deposit there all the code (scripts) that you will be generating
      + Your Git Repo will be graded
    + There is no way to fake things in DigiBio
      + You either do things or you don't
    + This class is a *FAST MOVING TARGET*
    + This class is *very unforgiving* to the possibility of you taking
      a day off. If you miss one lecture you probably will get very,
      very far behind and you might not be able to recover...
    + In an ideal scenario, in the end, we will be analyzing a new dataset
    + The idea here is for you to leave the class having demonstrated expertise in data analysis
  + *DISCLAIMER*
    + We are dealing with computers
    + When dealing with computers anything can happen
      + The network can go down (happened in the past)
      + The machine can crash  
      + These are things that are beyond my control
  + Conclusion: This class follows a new paradigm

+ *Brief Discussion about Bootstrapping*
  + Definition: Computing a technique of loading a program into a
    computer by means of a few initial instructions which enable the
    introduction of the rest of the program from an input device.
  + Bootstrapping in Biology
    + Typical examples of bootstrapping in Biology include but are not restricted to /translation/
      + To produce a /Protein/, you need:
        : mRNA + Ribosomes + tRNAs + AminoAcids
        : mRNA = DNA + RNA Polymerase II (Protein)
        : Ribosomes = RNA + Proteins
        : RNA = DNA + RNA Polymerase I (Protein)
        : Proteins = mRNA + Ribosomes + tRNAs + AminoAcids
  + Bootstrapping in Digital Biology
